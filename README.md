Sure, here's a basic example of a README.md file for your project:

```markdown
# Data Engineer Task 2

This project is a Spark job that ingests one or multiple CSV files into DeltaLake. The job is designed to handle files with and without headers. It adds two extra columns to the output DataFrame: `ingestion_tms` (ingestion timestamp) and `batch_id` (UUID v4). The job uses APPEND write mode to atomically add new data to the Delta table.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PySpark 3.3.1
- DeltaLake 1.2.1

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Docker Compose file to start the Spark job and the Spark History Server:

```bash
docker-compose up
```
