Sure, here's a basic example of a README.md file for your project:

```markdown
# Data Engineer Task 2

This project is a Spark job that ingests one or multiple CSV files into DeltaLake. The job is designed to handle files with and without headers. It adds two extra columns to the output DataFrame: `ingestion_tms` (ingestion timestamp) and `batch_id` (UUID v4). The job uses APPEND write mode to atomically add new data to the Delta table.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- PySpark 3.3.1
- DeltaLake 1.2.1

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the Docker Compose file to start the Spark job and the Spark History Server:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## Docker Compose and Dockerfile

The Docker Compose file runs the Spark job from a container and includes a Spark History Server service. The Spark History Server uses the image `gcr.io/spark-operator/spark:v2.4.0` and runs the Spark History Server with the command `/sbin/tini -s -- /opt/spark/bin/spark-class -Dspark.history.fs.logDirectory=/path/to/log/dir org.apache.spark.deploy.history.HistoryServer`.

The Dockerfile sets up the environment for the Spark job and specifies how to run it.

## System Diagram
